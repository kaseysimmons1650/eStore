				<h1>About Us</h1>

				<h1>How It Works</h1>
				<p>Vinyl Vault is a platform for buying, selling, and trading records. To get started you need to create a user profile. This user account lets you add the records you have, the records you are looking for, and even the records you would be willing to trade or sell. Once your account is created you can then search for records you want to purchase. Some times, you can have a choice if the record comes new from one of our retailers or if available, you would be able to purchase or trade from another user on the site. The user profile can also be used to connect with other listeners with similar interests! </p>
					<p><b>How to create an account:</b></p>
						<ol>
							<li><small>follow the create account link</small></li>
							<li><small>fill out the form</small></li>
							<li><small>wait for our staff to verify your profile</small></li>
							<li><small>once your account is verified, you can start to buy, sell and trade records!</small></li>
						</ol>
