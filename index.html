					<p>We are a virtual record store that originated in 2022. Our founder, Kasey is a collector of vinyl records and want to share her passion with the world. She has been collecting records since she was young and was able to inherit her parents' and grandparents' collections of records. Ever since then she has been listening and collecting more records. In 2022, Kasey wanted to make her dream a reality and created a place for buying, selling, and trading records. <i><em>Thus, Vinyl Vault was born!</em></i></p>

					<p>Vinyl Vault is a platform for buying, selling, and trading records. To get started you need to create a user profile. This user account lets you add the records you have, the records you are looking for, and even the records you would be willing to trade or sell. Once your account is created you can then search for records you want to purchase. Some times, you can have a choice if the record comes new from one of our retailers or if available, you would be able to purchase or trade from another user on the site. The user profile can also be used to connect with other listeners with similar interests! </p>
					<p><b>How to create an account:</b><br>
						<ol>
							<li><small>follow the create account link</small></li>
							<li><small>fill out the form</small></li>
							<li><small>wait for our staff to verify your profile</small></li>
							<li><small>once your account is verified, you can start to buy, sell and trade records!</small></li>
						</ol>
